## 1. Simple card
```
I would like a snazzy card component that displays information about a blog post.

The component should contain: 
- image
- title
- summary
- 'Read more' button

Component name: `SnazzyCard01`

Please make the card as exciting and bold as you can! I want to see cool colours, gradients, etc. Be creative! 

There should be a max width of about a third of a laptop screen.

The image should be on the left and the text & button should be on the right.
